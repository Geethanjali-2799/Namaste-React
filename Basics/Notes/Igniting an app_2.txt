npm : is a package manager
    : it is a standard repository for all Packages(...).

npm init ------> install package.json into current working directory

package.json --> is a configuration file for npm
             --> NEEDED FOR-->managing dependencies

package1:  bundler-->bundles/packages ur app so that u can ship to production

bundler(webpack,wheat,parcel)-->choose parcel for creating dependencies

2 dependencies can be installed--> normal dependencies(both development and production) and Dev dependencies(require during development)
PARCEL:
    parceljs is open source javascript tool that bundles web applications
    npm install -D parcel ----> Dev dependencies
    --> ^(caret) --> parcel updates its version automatically to latest if it is minor version, prefer using caret 
    --> ~(tidler) --> install major version automatically
    after this cmd ran package-locj.json file is created
    and also node modules folder is created  (this has all code of parcel)--> is kind od database for dependencies

Package.json(keeps approx version of packages that are being installed) vs Package-lock.json(keeps track of exact versions of all packages which is installed)
This package-lock.json file is very imp that it helps to maintain exact version when application is sent to production

alone using package.json and package-lock.json we can recreate node modules usin npm install so we can ignore sharing node modules to git

npx-->for executing a package npx is used
 
npx parcel index.html ---> here we r executing parcel=======> for development
npx parcel build index.html =======> for production

npm install react ------> to install react inside package.json file
npm install react-dom ----> to also install react dom package
What does parcel/any bundler do?
--> It provides DEV Build
--> provides local server
--> HMR -- hot module replacement --> when a file is updated and saved it automatically the page is refreshed -- this is done with hmr by parcel
    all these are kept track by Parcel, it uses File watching algorith (written in c++) 
--> Parcel is doing Caching --for faster builds
--> image optimization
--> minify the file size--> by using some libraries
--> Bundling
--> compressing


Browserslist---> to allow how many versions of browsers can be allowed
